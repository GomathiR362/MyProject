                                    Stress Prediction Using Ensemble Methods

Overview:
This project aims to predict student stress levels using ensemble methods, leveraging four different algorithms: Decision Tree, Random Forest, AdaBoost, and XGBoost. By combining the predictions from multiple models, we create a more robust and accurate stress prediction system.

Algorithms Used:

1. Decision Tree: A decision tree is a simple yet powerful algorithm that creates a tree-like structure of decision rules. Each decision node represents a feature, and each leaf node represents a class label.

2. Random Forest: Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees and combines their predictions through voting or averaging. This approach improves accuracy and robustness.

3. AdaBoost: AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting) is an ensemble learning method that sequentially combines weak learners, such as decision trees, by assigning higher weights to misclassified instances. This iterative process focuses on improving the performance of previously misclassified data points.

4. XGBoost: XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) is an optimized implementation of gradient boosting that uses decision trees as base learners. It introduces regularization terms to control overfitting and employs advanced optimization techniques to improve computational efficiency and predictive performance.

**Data:**
The dataset used for this project contains various features related to student activities, academic performance, and personal circumstances. Features include academic workload, social interactions, extracurricular activities, and self-reported stress levels.

Workflow:
1. Data Preprocessing: Null values are checked and handled, and standard scaling is applied to normalize the features.
2. Model Training: The dataset is split into training and testing sets. Each algorithm is trained on the training set.
3. Model Evaluation: The trained models are evaluated on the testing set using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
4. Ensemble Prediction: Ensemble methods combine the predictions from all four models to make the final stress predictions.

Results:
The performance of each algorithm is evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Additionally, the ensemble method's performance is compared to individual algorithms to demonstrate its effectiveness in stress prediction.

Conclusion:
By utilizing ensemble methods and combining the strengths of multiple algorithms, this project provides a robust and accurate stress prediction system. The results highlight the effectiveness of ensemble learning in improving prediction accuracy, which can be valuable for identifying and addressing student stress in educational settings. Further enhancements and optimizations can be explored to refine the stress prediction model and extend its applicability in real-world scenarios.
